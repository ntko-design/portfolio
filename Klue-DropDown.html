          <h3>Internal Design System Component | April 2023</h3>
          <p>A design system project initially focused on responsive dropdown sizes. It grew into a comprehensive
            initiative that revamped the design component and backend code to standardize menu properties, simplify
            implementation, and enhance the end user experience.</p>

                <p>As a Guild member, I examined existing dropdowns in Klue to inform the design of responsive mockups.

                  areas like font sizes, drop shadows, and dividers between sections.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>The project's evolution beyond its initial requirements resulted in a highly beneficial solution for the
            product team. This experience taught me the importance of being proactive and how considering aspects beyond
            project briefs can improve project outcomes. It also provided insights on effective collaboration with
            developers as it encouraged me to deeply understand their work process.</p>

          <p>If I had more time to delve further into this project, I would have liked to focus more on the developer
            side of it. I believe that there may be opportunities to make the content area even more efficient by
            enabling developers to quickly generate predetermined layouts using the most common components. This could
            potentially provide even greater benefits for my colleagues.</p>

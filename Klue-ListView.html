          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Throughout this project, I learned the importance of presenting design iterations early and often. Sharing
            both successful and unsuccessful design concepts allows colleagues to understand what options have been
            explored, and can inspire their own ideas. This, in turn, can lead to productive discussions about the
            project's scope, limitations, and future potential to lead to a better solution.</p>

          <p>If there was more time to spare, I believe additional sessions could have been conducted to improve the
            List View design. While we had the opportunity to speak to the most passionate of users, they only represent
            one user group, and it is important to understand that testing with more demographics helps to consider all
            aspects of a design.</p>

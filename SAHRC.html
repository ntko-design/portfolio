          <h3>UX Design Student Project | September - December 2018</h3>
          <p>Food for the Heart is a mobile health application that aims to raise awareness about heart disease for
            South Asian post-secondary students in the Fraser Valley. It suggests culturally rooted meals meant to
            reduce the risk of developing heart disease, and collaborates with local South Asian grocery stores to
            encourage healthier food habits.</p>

                <p>Within the South Asian community, heart disease is an extremely common health concern. Many

                  of dying from heart attacks and strokes.</p>

                <p>Its prevalence can be drawn from the fact that <mark>South Asian diets are high in cholesterol, and
                    most live sedentary lives</mark>. Preventative measures are the most effective, but because
                  <mark>South Asian youth often can't relate to heart disease</mark>, many do not take action when it
                  matters most.

                <p>I also took notes during these meetings to later draw insights. From my findings, two things became

                <p>By educating on heart disease through introducing culturally specific dishes, South Asian
                  post-secondary students are able to become more proactive about their dietary habits. This in turn
                  supports SAHRC's goal of promoting heart disease preventative initiatives, and paves the way for
                  future research opportunities.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>From this project, having the chance to apply various design methods has shown me their importance in any
            design process. By taking the time to understand clients, end users, and their interactions both with each
            other and with the product itself, the resultant knowledge can help inform crucial design decisions.
          </p>

          <p>This concept can be refined through a more thorough design process. For example, we only created
            post-secondary student personas, limiting us from understanding other stakeholders such as SAHRC members.
            Having a more diverse set of personas could have helped us determine how to provide an experience that is
            widely applicable for all stakeholders, especially during the onboarding process.</p>

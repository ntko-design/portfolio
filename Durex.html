              <div class="content_order">
                <p>Like many of its competitors, Durex's brand highlights pleasure and intimacy. Durex wants to shift
                  its branding towards sexual well-being, however, gaps in their marketing campaigns and communication
                  channels contradict this goal.</p>

                <p>Given the inadequacy of high school sexual education, there is an opportunity for Durex to
                  destigmatize anxieties surrounding sexual health. By focusing on safety and education, Durex could
                  open up conversations about topics that schools fail to mention.</p>

                <p>For high schoolers, our solution helps normalize the idea of sex by opening up conversation about
                  consent between partners, teaching them how to foster healthy relationships. Meanwhile, this shift to
                  safety and education allows Durex to solidify their stance as a sexual well-being brand.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This project had changed substantially since week 1, reaffirming how crucial it is to stay open to new
            ideas and to be willing to both rework and drop concepts when they no longer work. It also taught me how to
            think of design within the context of business needs and problems, rather than being driven solely by
            research to create innovative and joyful solutions.</p>

          <p>Aside from looking into how to best onboard teenagers onto DurexEd, one area of improvement would be to
            implement additional ways to teach consent, as scenario-based learning may not be the most effective
            teaching method for all teens. Bringing in other relevant concepts like sexual assault and mutual respect
            could also help solidify the concept's focus on fostering sexual well-being and healthy relationships.</p>

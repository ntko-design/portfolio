          <h3>UX Design Student Project | March - April 2019</h3>
          <p>LEGO Storybricks is a conceptual tablet application that facilitates interactive storytelling by
            interweaving LEGO with communication technology. It aims to connect parents separated from their children by
            distance in order to maintain healthy relationships with their kids and to cultivate early childhood growth
            and development.</p>

                <p>When it comes time to build solutions, playful animations and a large button are used to signify the
                  important shift away from role-playing. In build moments, children are given the opportunity to build
                  things to help overcome whatever problem the story presents them.</p>

                <p>Both parents and children build LEGO models, but for the sake of fairness, and to emphasize the
                  importance of their growth, the story will only progress once kids are done with their models to let
                  them build at their own pace.</p>

                <p>For parents, our solution allows them to spend quality time with their kids and to remain involved as
                  role models despite being far from home. For children, this learning experience allows them to bond
                  with their parents, making them feel cared for.</p>

                <p>As for LEGO, our solution leverages their expertise with toys in both physical and digital spaces,
                  aligning itself with their goal of bringing parents and children together, one brick at a time.</p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Despite the short timeframe, this project taught me how to consider the needs and values of unfamiliar
            target audiences and how to design with them in mind. It reinforced the importance of identifying domain
            problems, as well as the methods to do so, and framing to create meaningful and satisfying experience
            design.</p>

          <p>One area I would like to explore more is how to tactically introduce LEGO Storybricks to the parents and
            children who would need it most. My team and I thought to establish an entry point via digital receipts, but
            I feel that the idea was very transaction-centric. I also want to refine the interfaces and concepts behind
            saving builds to further accentuate the aspects of bonding and quality play.</p>
